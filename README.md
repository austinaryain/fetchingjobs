# Fetch Rewards

Hi! My name is Austin Aryain and this is my Android Developer challenge for Fetch Rewards.


# Libraries
For clean, declarative recyclerviews I use the Library Epoxy by AirBnB.
  
For a better user experience with a large list of data I use a Swipe Refresh Layout.

For Dependency Injection I chose to use Dagger Hilt.

For the network request I decided to setup a Retrofit Client.
 
For simple JSON Serialization I used Kotlinx Serialization and Jake Wharton's Retrofit converter.

And for simpler network error handling and response I really enjoy using Arrow.
