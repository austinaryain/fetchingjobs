# Fetch Rewards

Android Developer challenge for Fetch Rewards.


## Libraries
For UI I used Jetpack Compose.

For Dependency Injection I chose to use Dagger Hilt.

For the network request I decided to setup a Retrofit client.
 
For simple JSON Serialization I used Kotlinx Serialization and Jake Wharton's Retrofit converter.

And for simpler network error handling and response I really enjoy using Arrow.
